# Hook Model

Is a four-phase process that businesses can use to create products or services used habitually by customers. The goal is to result in voluntary, high-frequency engagement. At its core, the Hook Model is about creating a customer habit. It also seeks to connect a customer’s problem to a company’s solution with enough frequency to make the engagement an ongoing practice. The phases of this model are:

### Trigger
This is the action that makes the habit happen. When for example, you feel intrigued about something, you just google it; the intrigue is the trigger here. It's the spark that ignites the process. There's internal triggers (feeling and cravings) and external triggers (advertising)

### Action
This is the thing that you want your user to do after a *Trigger*, or the habit as a whole. This can be go to your product to satiate a need. For example, when you crave social interaction you go to Facebook and scroll through the feed; the action here is scrolling.  

### Variable Reward
It's the outcome you get from doing an *Action*. There are three types of Variable Reward (The tribe, the hunt and the self). Rewards of the tribe is the search for social rewards fueled by connectedness with other people (social reward). Rewards of the hunt is the search for material resources and information (career rewards). Rewards of the self is the search for intrinsic rewards of mastery, competence, and completion (getting better at something). Variable rewards must satisfy users needs while leaving them wanting to reengage with the product

Experiences with finite variability become increasingly predictable with use and lose their appeal over time. Experiences that maintain user interest by sustaining variability with use exhibit infinite variability. 

### Investment
It's putting some kind of effort so the user is more likely to come back and use the product. This basically means inputting data, money, etc. This secures that the person using the app is gonna use it more the more it uses it; because once you invested something is far more difficult to eliminate it's usage. For example, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have a lot of Investment thanks to the fact that the information you input is tedious or impossible to retrieve, so once you start making post it's unlikely that you are gonna switch to a competitor.
