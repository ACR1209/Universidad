# Moonwalking With Einstein - Joshua Foer

A non-fiction book, that expresses the science behind memory but, more importantly, the story of the author in the process of becoming the champion of memory of the United States of America. The style is as if you were reading an article more than a book. Relies heavily in the concept of a [[Mind Palace]] as a tool for remembering things accurately and easily. The thing that interested me the most is the concept of the [Major System](https://artofmemory.com/wiki/Major_System/), which allows you to memorize numbers by transforming them into *sounds*, and then into *images for the memory palace*. Overall I consider this book to be a well rounded and interesting book. The concepts presented are pretty interesting, but as the author explains:

> Itâ€™s that it is so hard to find occasion to use them (*the memorization techniques*) in the real world in which paper, computers, cell phones, and Post-its can handle the task of remembering for me.

I want to dwindle into this topic a bit, as it seamed interesting. Even though it might not prove as useful I want to learn, at the very least, the aforementioned Major System.
