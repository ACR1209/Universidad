# Hooked - Nir Eyal

This is a non fiction book. It explains how to build products that focus on creating and maintaining habits. It's heavily based on the [[Hook Model]] (Trigger, Action, Variable Reward, Investment) to describe a guideline to make a habit forming product. 

According to the author we should ask the following questions to build effective hooks:

>1. What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving? (Internal trigger) 
>2. What brings users to your service? (External trigger) 
>3. What is the simplest action users take in anticipation of reward, and how can you simplify your product to make this action easier? (Action) 
>4. Are users fulfilled by the reward yet left wanting more? (Variable reward) 
>5. What “bit of work” do users invest in your product? Does it load the next trigger and store value to improve the product with use? (Investment)

Overall it's a good book, it helps to implement it's knowledge on it's *"Do it now"* sections. The book is more of a how-to book focused on showing the implementation of the ideas in contrast with real life examples. The Hook Model seems interesting, even if it's just a guideline. I should look more in trying to get to know how to develop this kind of products (specially for software), because this books seems kinda old; maybe other techniques have been invented. Finally, I feel this book is really practical and has a lot of implications that I can use on the future.
