# Ego Is The Enemy - Ryan Holiday

This is a non fiction book, that focuses on explaining through history why ego in the sense of  "ego is an unhealthy belief in our own importance. Arrogance. Self-centered ambition" can be detrimental to us. It explains the areas where ego can affect us more in steps of some sorts, this are: Aspiration, Success and Failure. In aspiration the author tells us to _**be more focused on doing than on being**_ (this is the main takeaway I get get from this book). In success, the author refers that we have to have the capability to still learn even when we "succeeded", and not letting the success get to our head. In failure, the author tells us to be prepared to face failure and to embrace it using it to start a new cycle of aspiration, success and failure again; he tells us that we have to learn from the failures and use them as opportunities instead of challenges to ourselves.

This fragment of the epilogue can summarize the core principles at which, this book, adheres: 

> That it’s admirable to want to be better businessmen or businesswomen, better athletes, better conquerors. We should want to be better informed, better off financially . . . We should want, as I’ve said a few times in this book, to do great things. I know that I do.
> 
> But no less impressive an accomplishment: being better people, being happier people, being balanced people, being content people, being humble and selfless people. Or better yet, all of these traits together. And what is most obvious but most ignored is that perfecting the personal regularly leads to success as a professional, but rarely the other way around. Working to refine our habitual thoughts, working to clamp down on destructive impulses, these are not simply the moral requirements of any decent person. They will make us more successful; they will help us navigate the treacherous waters that ambition will require us to travel. And they are also their own reward.

I like this book, even when there are certain ideas where the author bring to an extreme (kinda like a caricature of ego). It has made me realize that I have to work toward being less egotistical to be happier.
