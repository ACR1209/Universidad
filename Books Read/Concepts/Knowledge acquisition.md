# Knowledge acquisition
According to Steven Kotler there are 5 steps to get knowledge a be sure you understand the subject enough to have a position in it (not to confuse with expertise):

- Read 5 books: Start with the best selling book on the topic -> Also a popular book but a bit more technical -> First semi-technical book, easy to read but perhaps not exciting -> Hard but that gives you an idea of what the expert use -> No necessarily the hardest read, but hardest to comprehend (it talks about the future of the topic)
- Be the idiot: ask the questions that no one wants to ask until you can comprehend the faults you have
- Ask the next question: ask where is the topic going and intersections on the knowledge you have with this particular topic
- Find the narrative: understand the why and follow a history of the topic, this makes it easier for the brain to proccess.
