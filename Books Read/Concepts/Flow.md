# Flow
Is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by the complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting transformation in one's sense of time.

## Characteristics of a flow state
Tasks that tend to encourage a state of flow often share similar characteristics. These tasks may be:
- Challenging, but not so much that they are impossible
- Rewarding, meaning that a person gets a sense of pleasure or purpose from doing it
- In-depth, involving an investment of some time or energy to make progress

Some signs that a person is in a state of flow include:
- Focus: It is not easy to distract people in flow from their task. They may not be thinking about anything else. If a person or event interrupts someone in flow, they may feel annoyed.
- Lack of self-consciousness: Flow is associated with a decrease in “self-referential thinking,” which means that a person in this state is unlikely to be thinking about themselves, their performance, or how others might see them.
- Enjoyment: People may enjoy the task, encouraging them to immerse themselves in it.
- Persistence: Some evidence suggests that being in flow can offset the frustration of a difficult task, allowing people to keep going.
