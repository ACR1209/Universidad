# How To Learn Any Language Quickly, Easily, Inexpensively, Enjoyably and on Your Own - Barry Farber

This is a non-fiction book that tries to explain the process to obtain and master a new language. It's quite outdated using casete tapes as a prevalent example, but the advice still stands just with YouTube and recording yourself. It uses [[Mind Palace]] or mnemonic techniques to learn vocabulary in the target language. It basically advices to have 6 tools to learn a language:

- Basic Textbook: the ones that have grammar and exercises.
- Dictionary: the one that has the definition and translation of words (in modern times can be replace with a simple google search)
- Phrases book: the ones used to know basic phrases as a tourist.
- Newspaper: to learn new words in a real world example
- Audio: to hear on YouTube and to record yourself
- Flash Cards: to put words in a current language and a target language.

>Stay with it. Keep pressing ahead with all tools in all the ways suggested, plus whatever other ways you discover en route that seem to work for you. Keep pursuing opportunities to use what you learn, not just in exercises and self-simulation, but in genuine, real-life conversation, reading, writing and comprehension. 
>
>When will you "arrive"? When will you no longer "be studying" but "have learned" the language? 
>
>Never! At least, pretend never. Your linguistic infancy will lead to babyhood, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood-and so on. Your fragments of knowledge will lead to competence. 
>
>Your competence will lead to fluency. Your fluency will intensify to higher and higher levels of fluency. 
>
>The best attitude, however, is that your attempt to master the foreign language, should remain perpetually unfinished business. 
>
>You'll succeed if you make sure you never go to bed knowing no more of your target language than you did when you woke up!

This is a good book that gives a really good way of learning a new language, overall great.
