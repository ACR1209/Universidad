# Numsense! Data Science for the Layman (No Math Added) - Annalyn Ng and Kenneth Soo

This is a non fiction book. Focused on [[Ingenieria en Software/Data Science/Data Science]] and it's concepts. It explains these using real life examples like finding customers clusters, titanic survivors, relationships between countries and their influence, etc. Introduces concept vital to data science, such as A/B Testing, Neuronal Networks, Decision Tree and Random Forests, k-means Clustering, PCA, Social Network Analysis and Regression Analysis.

> Imagine yourself as a young doctor. A patient enters your clinic, complaining of breathlessness, chest pains, and the occasional heartburn. You check that his blood pressure and heart rate readings are normal, and that he has had no previous medical conditions. Sizing him up, you notice that he looks plump. As his symptoms are common among people who are overweight, you reassure him that everything is under control and recommend that he finds time to exercise. 
> 
> All too often, this situation results in a misdiagnosis of heart diseaseâ€”as patients with heart disease exhibit symptoms similar to those of common obesity, doctors often pass over further checks that would detect the more serious condition. 
> 
> As humans, our judgements are constrained by limited, subjective experiences and incomplete knowledge. This impairs our decision-making process and could, as in the case of an inexperienced doctor, arrest further tests that would have led to more accurate conclusions. 
> 
> This is where data science can help. 
> 
> Instead of relying on the judgement of one individual, data science techniques allow us to harness information from more data sources to make better decisions. For instance, we could check historical records of patients reporting similar symptoms to uncover possible diagnoses that were previously overlooked. 
> 
> With modern computing and advanced algorithms, we are able to: 
> - Identify hidden trends in large datasets 
> - Leverage trends to make predictions 
> - Compute the probability of each possible outcome 
> - Obtain accurate results quickly

This quote summarizes the book, it seeks to find a way to explain the field of data science in simple terms explaining the concepts in a logical way instead of a mathematical way. Overall this can be seen as a pretty good roadmap that I will examine on a near future.
