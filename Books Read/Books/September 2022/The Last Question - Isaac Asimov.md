# The Last Question - Isaac Asimov

This is a short novel that explores the idea of the finite nature of the universe, making a point in entropy. There's a computer that evolves itself throughout the years, and finds solutions to the problems of mankind (utilizing the energy of the sun, interplanetary travel, interestelar travel, immortality, etc.)  the novel explores asking the computer "How can we reverse entropy?" over the eons getting the response "INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER" over a over again till humanity fused with this computer on the Heat Death of the universe; and after a long time the computer found the answer.

> The stars and Galaxies died and snuffed out, and space grew black after ten trillion years of running down. 
> 
> One by one Man fused with AC (Analog computer), each physical body losing its mental identity in a manner that was somehow not a loss but a gain. 
> Man’s last mind paused before fusion, looking over a space that included nothing but the dregs of one last dark star and nothing besides but incredibly thin matter, agitated randomly by the tag ends of heat wearing out, asymptotically, to the absolute zero. 
> Man said, “AC, is this the end? Can this chaos not be reversed into the Universe once more? Can that not be done?” 
> 
> AC said, “THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.” 
> 
> Man’s last mind fused and only AC existed-and that in hyper-space. 
> Matter and energy had ended and with it space and time. Even AC existed only for the sake of the one last question that it had never answered from the time a half-drunken computer ten trillion years before had asked the question of a computer that was to AC far less than was a man to Man. 
> 
> All other questions had been answered, and until this last ques-tion was answered also, AC might not release his consciousness. 
> 
> All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected. 
> 
> But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships. 
> 
> A timeless interval was spent in doing that. 
> 
> And it came to pass that AC learned how to reverse the direction of entropy. But there was now no man to whom AC might give the answer of the last question. No matter.

This is a fun short novel that tries to convey that even the perceived infinite is in reality finite, good book.
