# Notes On Grief - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie

This is a short story of the thoughts of the author through the process of grieving his father death. It reads as if it was a diary, seeing what goes in her mind and the despair she goes through and embraces at the end. 

> It does not matter whether I want to be changed, because I am changed. A new voice is pushing itself out of my writing, full of the closeness I feel to death, the awareness of my own mortality, so finely threaded, so acute. A new urgency. An impermanence in the air. I must write everything now, because who knows how long I have?

This is a deep short story filled with a lot of emotions and it shows in the writing. Overall, this book is amazing.
