# The Yellow Wallpaper - Charlotte Perkins
This is a short novel that tell the history of a woman that's sent to "bed rest" in an attic in a temporary house. The novel is narrated from the point of view of the women, and how her mental state starts to decay thanks to the ugly yellow wallpaper. This is a piece of feminist literature, where the author tries to convey how women were treated at the time. At the end the woman turns crazy, watching women come out of the wallpaper and tearing it apart, believing she is one of them. 

> If a physician of high standing, and one's own husband, assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression—a slight hysterical tendency—what is one to do?

This last paragraph show how the novel criticizes the  power that men *especially doctors* of the epoch held. Overall is a short but sweet novel, I liked the concept and the idea behind it.

## Rating: 8/10
