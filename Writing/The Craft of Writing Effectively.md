## Steps taken by people where the writing is not clear
1. They slow down: this means re-reading or slow reading a text.
2. They get confused: they don't understand the meaning.
3. They get aggravated: they don't like that's written like that.
4. They stop: they skip or full stop reading the text.

## Considerations to write effectively
- The work has to have value above all else.
- Consider your audience: the value of a text is considered by the readers.
