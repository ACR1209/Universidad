Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called [[Containers|containers]] that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run.

## Why Docker?

- Avoids the "works on my machine" problem.
- They are lightweight and fast.
- Better resource utilization, meaning we can host more applications in a single machine than with a VM.
- Standard development interface with docker run.
- Docker hub to solve common problems.
