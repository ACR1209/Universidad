It stands for **Comma Separated Values** and is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format. A CSV file typically stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, in which case each line will have the same number of fields.

This type of file allows to store data as a spreadsheet but in plain text form.

## Example of CSV
Year,Make,Model,Description,Price
1997,Ford,E350,"ac, abs, moon",3000.00
1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition""","",4900.00
1999,Chevy,"Venture ""Extended Edition, Very Large""","",5000.00
1996,Jeep,Grand Cherokee,"MUST SELL!
air, moon roof, loaded",4799.00

The first line tells us the value that we are representing, making this into a table we would have:

|Year|Make|Model|Description|Price|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|1997|Ford|E350|ac, abs, moon|3000.00|
|1999|Chevy|Venture "Extended Edition"||4900.00|
|1999|Chevy|Venture "Extended Edition, Very Large"| |5000.00
|1996|Jeep|Grand Cherokee|MUST SELL! air, moon roof, loaded|4799.00
