> A computer program is said to learn from a experience *E* with respecto to some task *T* and some performance measure *P*, if its performance on *T*, as measured by *P*, improves with experience *E*
> \-Tom Mitchell, 1997

## Types of Machine Learning

- [[Supervised Learning]]
- [[Unsupervised Learning]]

## Dividing data
We need to divide the data between two sets, training and testing data. To be able to evaluate the model that was made. 

## Problem with the data
- [[Overfitting training data]]
- [[Underfitting training data]]
