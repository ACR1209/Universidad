In these type of machine learning, we feed data to the algorithms, were the data is labeled and we know what the output should look like, by having a relationship between input values *X* and output values *Y*. 

All the [[Feature|features]] have to be independent features, meaning is the primary data and the [[Label|target feature or label ]] is a dependent variable that is build by the independent features.

## Types of problems
- Regression: for continuos data, it takes what happened in the past and tries to predict data based on what happened in the past.
- Classification: for discrete data, it tries to classify something into a group.
