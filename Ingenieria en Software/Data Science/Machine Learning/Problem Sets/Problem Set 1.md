**1.) What do you think machine learning is? It will be better if you explain what you think?** 
Machine Learning is the set of algorithms that allow a computer program to encounter patterns in the data and make useful prediction with a rate of confidence.

**2.) This is a formal definition by Tom Mitchell:
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.**
True

**3.) Do try to understand this definition about ML and explain with the help of an Email spam detection example, meaning What is E in spam detection, what T in spam detection and what is P in Spam detection.**
E: the data of the multiple emails marked as spam and ham.
T: identify spam or ham.
P: the rate at which identifies spam and ham correctly

**4.) What are some types of machine learning and can you say these types with the help of examples?**
There is two types supervised learning and unsupervised learning. With supervised learning we can get the prices of a stock in the future analyzing the previous values of the price and other factors. With unsupervised learning we learn by force to identify the pattern, for example, to identify handwritten letters.

**5.) Let’s take one scenario you’re working on house price prediction, so assume that you’re given size of the house, # of fans, # of bedrooms and basis on these you have to predict the price, so can you say what are X’s here and what is y?** 
X: size of the house, # of fans and # of bedrooms
y: price of the house

**6.) Why x’s are called Independent and y’s are called dependent variables?**
X values are independent because they are not influenced by other data or variables and Y values are called dependent because they are influence by other variables where this variables are X.
