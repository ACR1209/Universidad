In traditional web applications, the browser is "dumb". It only fetches HTML data from the server, and all application logic is on the server. A server can be created using [Java Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) , [Python Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) or [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) to name just a few examples.
