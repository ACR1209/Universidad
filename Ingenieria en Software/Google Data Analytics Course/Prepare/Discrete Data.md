[[Data]] that is counted and has a limited number of values. Discrete data isn't limited to dollar amounts. Examples of other discrete data are stars and points. When partial measurements (half-stars or quarter-points) aren't allowed, the data is discrete. If you don't accept anything other than full stars or points, the data is considered discrete.
