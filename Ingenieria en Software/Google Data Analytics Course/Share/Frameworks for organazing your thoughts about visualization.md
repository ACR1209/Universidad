You learned about the David McCandless method in the first lesson on effective data visualizations, but as a refresher, the McCandless Method lists four elements of good data visualization: 

1.  **Information**: the data you are working with
2.  **Story**: a clear and compelling narrative or concept
3.  **Goal**: a specific objective or function for the visual
4.  **Visual form**: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression

Note: One useful way of approaching this framework is to notice the parts of the graphic where there is incomplete overlap between all four elements. For example, visual form without a goal, story, or data could be a sketch or even art. Data plus visual form without a goal or function is eye candy. Data with a goal but no story or visual form is boring. All four elements need to be at work to create an effective visual.

**2)** [**Kaiser Fung’s Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup**](https://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/junk-charts-trifecta-checkup-the-definitive-guide.html "Kaiser Fung’s Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup")

This approach is a useful set of questions that can help consumers of data visualization critique what they are consuming and determine how effective it is. The Checkup has three questions:

1.  What is the practical question? 
2.  What does the data say?
3.  What does the visual say? 

Note: This checklist helps you think about your data viz from the perspective of your audience and decide if your visual is communicating your data effectively to them or not. In addition to these frameworks, there are some other building blocks that can help you construct your data visualizations.
