Design thinking for data visualization involves five phases:

1.  **Empathize:** Thinking about the emotions and needs of the target audience for the data visualizationÂ 
2.  **Define:** Figuring out exactly what your audience needs from the data
3.  **Ideate:** Generating ideas for data visualization
4.  **Prototype:** Putting visualizations together for testing and feedback
5.  **Test:** Showing prototype visualizations to people before stakeholders see them
