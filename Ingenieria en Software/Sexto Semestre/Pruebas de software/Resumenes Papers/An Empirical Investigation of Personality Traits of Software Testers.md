## Abstract
> Software testing is the process of an execution based investigation of some aspects of the software’s quality. The efficiency of the process depends on the methods and technologies used, but crucially also on the human testers.

> We collected personality profiles using the big five factor model of around 200 software development practitioners. Analysis of this data indicates that software testers are significantly higher on the conscientiousness factor than other software development practitioners, while other factors remain broadly consistent.

## Introduction
> A software tester is a person whose primary responsibility is to test software before release, helping to increase the reliability of a software product by reporting bugs so that they can be fixed.

> This research study was designed to investigate whether certain personality traits, as captured by the five-factor model (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness), are over-represented among software testers.

## Background
> The few studies mentioned above explain the attributes of a software tester such as coping with a monotonous job, and cooperativeness. These characteristics are plausibly related to certain personality traits. The investigation of such characteristics and relevant personality traits are, therefore, important.

## Methodology

> In this research study, we collected the personality profiles of a large number of software engineers, based on the 50 item IPIP personality assessment test. We used a web-based survey as our research strategy since such a survey enables us to collect personality profiles of wide range of software engineers in a very short time.

> the research study involved a group of software testers and a group of software developers who were involved in other roles of software development. The objective of the research study was to collect the personality profiles of the two groups and to conduct a comparative analysis to find out if there are any notable trends and significant differences among the two groups.

## Results

> A total of 182 software engineers participated in our survey, and among them 45.1% were software testers. Among the rest of the participants 57% were programmers and 28% were managers.
> The majority of our participants were male irrespective of their role. This is not surprising since the majority of practitioners in the IT field are male. It is notable that there were a higher proportion of female participants among the software testers than in other respondents.

The most significant countries were Australia (7.7% tester  14.3% non testers), Bangladesh (8.2% testers and non-testers), USA (6% testers 13.2% non-testers)

## Discussion
> The results indicate that there is no significant difference in mean scores on the five factors except conscientiousness between software testers and the non-testers for our sample population.
> Conscientiousness is related to personal organization of people. Highly conscientious people tend to be more organized, disciplined and hard working


## Resumen

El estudio fue realizado en el 2015, donde su objetivo era investigar si existe alguna diferencia fundamental en la personalidad de los testers con otras ramas de TI, utilizando pruebas de evaluación de personalidad de 50 items IPIP (International Personality Item Pool) a través de un cuestionario web. El cuestionario fue tomado tanto por testers como por personas relacionadas en otros campos de TI; realizado a 182 ingenieros en software, donde 45.1% eran testers 57% eran programadores y 28% eran gerentes.  Los tres países con mayor cantidad de testers en el estudio en orden son Bangladesh, Australia y EEUU. La mayoría de testers (y de programadores) son del genero masculino, aunque es notable que el genero femenino posee una mayor proporción de testers a programadores.
