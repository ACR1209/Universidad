#Medium 
[See Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/pseudo-palindromic-paths-in-a-binary-tree/)

## Solution
```jupyter
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def pseudoPalindromicPaths (self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        
        ans = 0
        
        def dfs(node, seen):
            nonlocal ans
            
            # if the value was odd but a pair was 
            # found remove it from the odd set

                seen.remove(node.val)
            else:
                seen.add(node.val)

                dfs(node.right, seen.copy())
            
            # If there are no children left, then check that
            # there's only 1 odd number in the path
            if not node.left and not node.right and len(seen) <= 1:
