[See Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/numbers-with-same-consecutive-differences/)

## Solution 
```jupyter
class Solution:
    def numsSameConsecDiff(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[int]:
		# Create a set of the posible result 
		# (they're not going to be repeated)
        res = set()
        
        # Use Depth First Search to find the answer 
        def dfs(current, left):
	        """
	        Params
	        current: the number calculated so far.
	        left: the number of digits left to calculate. 
	        """
			
			# If there are no digits left to calculate, append the answer 
			# to the list of answers.
            if left == 0:

                return
			
			# Get the value of the last digit
            last = current % 10

	        # over 9 thus no being a digit anymore
