# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
#Easy 
[See Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)

## Solution

Remembering that inorder traversal means going through the tree from left to right, for example for this next tree:

![[Pasted image 20220907225109.png]]

The inorder traversal is (left, root, right):  4 2 5 1 3 

```jupyter
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        
        result = []
        # Recursive function that get the inorder traversal
        # this means (left, root, right)
        def inorder(node):
	        # if there is no node, "null" value stop recursing
            if not node:
                return
            # Recurse to the left of the tree
            inorder(node.left)
            # Append current node to the results list
            result.append(node.val)
            # Recurse to the right of the tree
            inorder(node.right)
        
		# Start recursing from the root 
        inorder(root)
        
        return result

```
