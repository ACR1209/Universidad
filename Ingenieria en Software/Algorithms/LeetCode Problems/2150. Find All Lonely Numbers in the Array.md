[See Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-lonely-numbers-in-the-array/)

## Solution
This solution uses a map to show the frequency such as the time complexity doesn't have to be squared.
```jupyter
class Solution:
    def findLonely(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Count the number of ocurrences of each item
        count = Counter(nums)
		
		# Loop through every number with it's frequency and 
		# check if it only appers once and if it's adjecent 
		# numbers dont apper at all
        return [x for x,f in count.items() if 
									       f == 1 and 
									       count[x - 1] == 0 and 
									       count[x + 1] == 0]
