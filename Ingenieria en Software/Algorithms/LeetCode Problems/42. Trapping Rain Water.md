# 42. Trapping Rain Water
#Hard 
[See Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

	## Solution
The solution is found by realizing that you can get the volume of water by using $v = min(height_{left}, height_{right}) - height_{current}$ this as shown on the picture:

```jupyter
class Solution:
    def trap(self, h: List[int]) -> int:
	    # Max height on the left of current element
        max_left = h[0]
        # Max height on the right of current element
        max_right = h[-1]
        # Index of the right and left element
        l, r = 0, len(h) - 1
        res = 0
		
        while l < r:
	        # If left is the min of the pointers 
	        # then we know the volume of water 
	        # we can put is equal to max_left - h[current_index] 
            if max_left <= max_right:
                l += 1
                max_left = max(max_left, h[l])
                res += max_left - h[l]
            else: 
                r -= 1
                max_right = max(max_right, h[r])
                res += max_right - h[r]
                
        return res

```
